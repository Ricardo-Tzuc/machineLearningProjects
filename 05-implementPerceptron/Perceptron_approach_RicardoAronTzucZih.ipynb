Intuition of Perceptron\n"," - The Perceptron is like a simple artificial neuron inspired by the functioning of neurons in our brain. Imagine you have a classification problem where you want to separate two sets of data with a straight line on a graph. The Perceptron can help you with that. \\\\\n"," Think of it as a \"pattern detector\". You give it input information, which could be any numerical data, such as temperature and humidity to predict whether or not it will rain. The Perceptron takes those inputs, multiplies them by some \"weights\" and then adds it all up. If the sum is greater than or equal to a certain threshold value, the Perceptron decides the answer is \"Yes\" (1), otherwise it says \"No\" (0). \\\\\n"," It is as if it has a scale with weights on it and, if the scale tips far enough to one side, it makes a decision. These \"weights\" are adjusted during training so that the Perceptron learns to make correct decisions. In essence, the Perceptron is a very simple way of learning to separate data into two categories using a straight line on a graph."],"metadata":{"id":"C4VhPNj3zvhz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.
